# Inspiration 
During my first year in university, many of my classes were online, and going forward, I may have to get used to this. I recorded all these classes, but sometimes, understanding the professor was difficult, so with this application, I can understand the lectures with ease if I have the text format of the audio. 

# Technology 
This web application was built using a Flask backend to manage app routes and process GET/POST requests. I also used HTML and CSS to create a simple front-end.
