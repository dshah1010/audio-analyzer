# Audio Analyzer
Who has tough times understanding their professor or teacher in online classes? Well, I very much did, so for the future, I can easily upload audio files to receive a perfect translation and clearly understand the content. This project analyzes the speech in a given .wav audio file and displays the text. 

Technologies: Python, Flask, HTML, CSS
